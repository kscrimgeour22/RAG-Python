# RAG-Python
The Python code to create a RAG Assistant on Azure. Includes: unzipping, chunking, Faiss file creating, uploading, assistant creation, and prompt creation.
The setup is that sections 1-4 define the functions and in section 5 is where the functions are called and run.
Watch the file locations and paths to make sure your data is imported.
I found that using WinRar a zip file creator worked better than the Mac compressor.
